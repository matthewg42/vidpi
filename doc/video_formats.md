Video Format
============

The best tested video format is as follows:

+ Container: MP4
+ Resolution: 720p or lower recommended (1080p might lead to frame dropping, and the projector type which is to be used with the system only has a native resolution of 854x480 anyway)
+ Frame rate: 24 fps
+ Video Codec: H.264
+ Audio codec: PCM 

The codec interpretation is done using ofxOmxplayer, which supports many other formats, but this is the recommended format.
